# Device Assembly

After having built the [Electric Assembly](electricassembly.md) and having printed and finished all [Printed parts](printedparts.md) all parts can be assembled to the full device.

User your soldering iron to press the threaded inserts into the lower housing, then insert the mountplugs into the lower housing if needed.

Cut a rectangle of acrylic glass to fit the upper housing.

Place the [Electric Assembly](electricassembly.md) on top of the acrylic glass onto the upper housing and use 2 M2 x 5 screws and 2 M2 nuts to attach.

Add the battery and find a place to lead the cable to the battery plug on the microcontroller. Double- and triplecheck polarity of the battery before plugging it into the microcontroller. I added 2 little drops of glue under the battery to ease handling afterwards.
I had to file a little edge off the buzzer to make battery and buzzer fit nicely.

Seat the assembled buttons into the assembly and be sure each button can operate freely.

Place the lower housing upright so it can accept the rest of the assembly.

Insert the assembly, buttons first, be sure all cables go in smoothly and dont block one the threads that connect lower and upper housing.
Once inserted add 4 M2 x 8mm screws for final attachment.
