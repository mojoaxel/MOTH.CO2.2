# Device Assembly

After having built the [Electric Assembly](electricassembly.md) and having printed and finished all [Printed parts](printedparts.md) all parts can be assembled to the full device.

User your soldering iron to press the threaded inserts into the lower housing, then insert the mountplugs into the lower housing if needed.

Cut a rectangle of acrylic glass to fit the upper housing.

Place the [Electric Assembly](electricassembly.md) on top of the acrylic glass onto the upper housing and use 2 M2 x 5 screws and 2 M2 nuts to attach.

Add the battery and find a place to lead the cable to the batter plug on the microcontroller. Double- and triplecheck polarity of the battery before plugging it into the microcontroller. I added 2 little drops of glue under the battery to ease handling afterwards.
I had to file a little edge off the buzzer to make battery and buzzer fit nicely.

Place the buttons into the lower housing, if you keep the housing positioned like in the picture, everything will stay in place during the next step.

Now you can slide the upper housing with the electric assembly attached to it into the lower housing and add 4 M2 x 8mm screws for final attachment.

Fully assembled.
